#Siglinpac
Proof-of-concept sticker archiving tool using web traversing libraries

## How to use
```siglinpac-cli "https://sticker.store/shop/product/12345" "c:\temp\stickers"```

1. Replace the url (keep the quotes) with the sticker product page you wish to archive
2. The path to where you want to store the stickers downloaded is optional. It will default to where the executable lives if you don't give it a path.
